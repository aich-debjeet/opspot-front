                objectionable content). We cannot predict when issues may arise with respect to the
                Services or the Content. Accordingly, except in jurisdictions where such provisions
                are restricted, in no event will we be liable to you or any third person or third-party

                paid to, and received by, us from you under the Agreement. You and we agree that
                the foregoing limitation of liability is an agreed allocation of risk between you and
                us. You acknowledge that absent your agreement to this limitation of liability, we

                Guidelines, Privacy Policy, Copyright Policy, and other documents relating to the

                Guidelines, we may suspend or permanently disengage or disable access to your

                it, in such an event this Agreement will continue to apply until that content is
                deleted. If immediate deletion would restrict our ability to investigate or identify
